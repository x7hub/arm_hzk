============================== Help Screen ====================================
   This program is intended for test of UART driver.
   First of all, please ensure that PC and ADS have the same transmission/
 reception parameters for each process.
   In menu, option 1, 2 or 3 is configurated with fixed transmission/reception
 parameters. Option 4 is selected for further test, you should manually set
 the transmission/receptions parameters.
   Note also that:
     1. When transfer characters from PC to ADS, the received file on ADS is 
 /tmp/receive.txt which you should compare the sent file from PC with manually.
     2. When transfer characters from ADS to PC, the generated file to be sent 
 on ADS is /tmp/txt.txt which you should compare the received file on PC with 
 manually.
